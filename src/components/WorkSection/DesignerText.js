        My primary passion lies in UX/UI design. By incorporating the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) into my research, I strive to connect technical performance with user perception. My ultimate goal is to enhance UX/UI design and create more enjoyable and meaningful experiences for users. I specialize in creating mockups for both mobile and web applications using tools like Adobe XD or Figma. Additionally, I have a strong interest in drawing, and I utilize Photoshop to bring my sketch-based projects to life.
