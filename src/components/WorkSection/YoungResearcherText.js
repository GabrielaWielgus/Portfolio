        I've had the privilege of working at AGH as a <b>Young Researcher</b>. <br />
        As a Young Researcher, I delve into the fascinating realm of Quality of Experience (QoE) research, analyzing data and crafting scientific publications. <br /><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        I have conducted numerous scientific studies, designing experiments with ecological validity in mind, focusing on an area called Quality of Experience (QoE). QoE refers to the subjective assessment of a user's overall experience when interacting with a product or service. It encompasses various factors, such as usability, responsiveness, aesthetics, and emotional response, which are crucial in determining the user's satisfaction and perception of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). 
          Specifically:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>
            "Your YouTube Our Lab" which resulted in the publication titled&nbsp;
          <a href="https://library.imaging.org/ei/articles/35/8/IQSP-261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          "Proposing more ecologically-valid experiment protocol using YouTube platform"
          </a> accepted at the "Image Quality and System Performance XX" conference.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Your Netflix Our Lab" - currently working on analyzing results and writing a scientific journal publication.
          </li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
          Additionally, I am involved in other experiments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Fix Your Netflix"</li>
          <li>"Watching with Friends"</li>
          <li>"LongTermStudy in Lab"</li>
        </ul>
