    Outside of work hours, I am a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My primary focus lies in frontend development, with a strong interest in mobile technologies. Currently, I am immersed in the development of a mobile application for my engineering project. This innovative application aims to revolutionize dog walking by helping users plan their walks and address common behavioral issues faced by pets.
