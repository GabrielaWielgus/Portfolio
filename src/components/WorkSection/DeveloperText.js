        Outside of work hours, I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My primary focus is on frontend development, and I have a keen interest in mobile technologies as well. Currently, I am in the process of developing a mobile application for my engineering project. The application aims to assist users in planning dog walks and addressing behavioral issues commonly faced by pets.
