                Currently, I am working as a Young Researcher at AGH, focusing on Quality of Experience (QoE) research. 
                Since May 2021, I have been actively involved in various projects related to QoE, including 
                "Your YouTube Our Lab" and "Your Netflix Our Lab." In the former, I published a research paper 
                titled
                "<a href="https://library.imaging.org/ei/articles/35/8/IQSP-261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#84C28C', textDecoration: 'none' }}>
                Proposing more ecologically-valid experiment protocol using YouTube platform</a>",
                which was accepted at the "Image Quality and System Performance XX" conference. Currently, 
                I am analyzing data and preparing a journal publication for the latter project. Additionally, 
                I am involved in ongoing experiments such as "Fix Your Netflix," "Watching with Friends," and 
                "LongTermStudy in Lab." These projects explore different aspects of QoE, including usability, 
                responsiveness, aesthetics, and emotional response, with the goal of enhancing user experiences.

                My primary passion lies in UX/UI design. By incorporating the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) into my research, I strive to connect technical performance with user perception. My ultimate goal is to enhance UX/UI design and create more enjoyable and meaningful experiences for users. I specialize in creating mockups for both mobile and web applications using tools like Adobe XD or Figma. Additionally, I have a strong interest in drawing, and I utilize Photoshop to bring my sketch-based projects to life.
